# breaking-bread


will want a nav bar to go between home page and contact us page
I dont think i will need a backend service at all - no persistence of data needed at this time. the primary interaction would be to view photos, send an email using mailto(), 

landing page 
  1. contact us option for email
    a. ask chelsea how the setup for this email should be
    b. do we want people to put their email in and have us contact them, generate an automated message, etc. 
  2. link to facebook group

second page for about us?
  1. mission statement/values

chelsea will add pictures and the logo she created on her iPad
