# breaking-bread


will want a nav bar to go between home page and contact us page
I dont think i will need a backend service at all - no persistence of data needed at this time. the primary interaction would be to view photos, send an email using mailto(), 

landing page 
  1. contact us option for email
  2. link to facebook group

second page for about us?
  1. mission statement/values

chelsea will add pictures and the logo she created on her iPad
